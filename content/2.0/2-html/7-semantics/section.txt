Title: Semantic HTML

----
Text:

- **Use the appropriate HTML element** to mark up content, not only `<div>` and `<span>`.
- You can use a reference such as [htmlreference.io](http://htmlreference.io/) for details on available elements and attributes.

### Links vs buttons

The rule is simple:

- If it goes somewhere else, it’s a `<a href="url">[…]</a>` element.
- If it performs a custom JS action, it’s a `<button>[…]</button>` element.

Avoid `<div onclick="[…]"></div>` or `<li onclick="[…]"></li>`: it can’t be focused with the keyboard, can’t be read by a screen reader, doesn’t work for SEO, etc.

Always use real links (`<a href="url">…</a>`) to navigate between pages, including for navigating between views in “single-page” applications. It’s better for accessibility, SEO, bookmarking and sharing.

### Semantic groups

In the `<body>` we try to group the page’s visible elements in 4 groups:

```twig
<body>
  <header>
    {# logo, search, etc. #}
  </header>
  <nav>
    {# primary navigation #}
  </nav>
  <main>
    {# page’s main content #}
  </main>
  <footer>
    {# more info about the site, links, etc. #}
  </footer>
</body>
```

It’s also possible to put the `<nav>` inside the `<header>`.

### Use the “search” role for the main search

If the page offers a search form, use the ARIA `search` role on this form:

```html
<form role="search" action="/site-search">
  […]
</form>
```

Important: `role="search"` must only appear once in the page.
