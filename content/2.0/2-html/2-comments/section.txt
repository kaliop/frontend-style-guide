Title: Comments

----
Text:

Write as few HTML comments (`<!-- Comment -->`) as possible:

- They should not contain technical information
- Or references to client requirements

It’s often better to use the templating language’s comment syntax instead. This helps sending fewer bytes to users, too.

Example:

Avoid:

```twig
<!-- External SVG sprite support for IE -->
<script>[…]</script>
```

Prefer:

```twig
{# External SVG sprite support for IE #}
<script>[…]</script>
```
