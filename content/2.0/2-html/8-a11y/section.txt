Title: Accessible HTML

----

Text:

We strive to create accessible user interfaces, whether the HTML is generated server-side or client-side in JavaScript. Here are a few guidelines to get you started on this topic.

### Use titles for structure

- Use H1, H2, H3 elements (lower levels are often unnecessary)
- If this conflicts with SEO needs, see if you can find a compromise (keep the main titles, maybe change a useful H1/H2 to a H3 so that it does not clash with SEO needs but is still listed in screen readers)

```html
<main>
  <h1>Page title</h1>
  […]
  <h2>A sub-section</h2>
  […]
  <h2>Another section</h2>
  […]
</main>
```

### Use text labels

Outside of content managed in a CMS, we need accessible text for:

- Logos (use the brand’s name, not `"logo"`) and other significant images
- Buttons or links with icons and no visible text

For links and buttons, this can look like:

```html
<a href="[…]">
  <img src="[…]" alt="Subscribe Now">
</a>

<button>
  <svg class="icon">
    <title>Subscribe Now</title>
    <path d="[…]"></path>
  </svg>
</button>
```

If you can’t add alt text to the image or icon itself, you can use `aria-label` on the link or button:

```html
<a href="[…]" aria-label="Subscribe Now">
  <i data-icon="letter"></i>
</a>
```

Finally, if the text is already present in context, it’s often better to have *empty* alt text:

```html
<a href="[…]">
  <img src="[…]" alt="">
  Subscribe Now
</a>

<button>
  <svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true"><path d="[…]"></path></svg>
  Subscribe Now
</button>
```

### Make sure that form elements have labels

Link a form element and the relevant label using `<label for="some-id">` and the `id` attribute.

```html
<p>
  <label for="user-name">My Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="user-name">
</p>

<p>
  <input type="checkbox" id="user-subscribe">
  <label for="user-subscribe">Subscribe me to the newsletter</label>
</p>
```

If done properly, clicking the label should focus the text input (or `<select>` or any other form control). Note that each `id` attribute must be unique in the page.
