Title: Use the DRY principle

----

Text:

Don’t Repeat Yourself: avoid code that is very similar in different places in the project.

In particular, avoid copying and pasting code in different places! Duplicated code is hard to maintain: you have to do the changes in 2, 5 or 10 places, and test each change.

- Templating: use includes, partials, macros…
- Styles: use components, utility classes, mixins…
- JavaScript: use functions, modules, components…

**This is not an absolute rule!** For example, if you need to make a variant that can evolve without impacting the first feature, some copy-pasting can be justified.
