Title: Maintain a README file

----
Text:

* Every project should have a `README.md` file (or just `README`).
* Every developer should read this file, and update it if needed.
* Use [Markdown syntax](http://commonmark.org/help/) for better readability in Bitbucket, GitHub, etc.

This `README.md` should exist at the root of the repository and give information on:

1. What the project is (client, site/app name)
2. How to install the project on a developerâ€™s machine
3. How to run development tasks (e.g. import data, compile frontend assets)
4. How to deploy the project

If this documentation gets too big, you can break it into several files for specialized topics:

```
README.md
doc/
    INSTALL.md
    FRONTEND.md
    DEPLOYMENT.md
```

Finally, if you set up a project from a boilerplate, and that boilerplate already has its own `README` file, see if you can remove it or rename it.
