Title: Use EditorConfig

----
Text:

Frontend code files should be:

- encoded as UTF-8,
- with `LF` end of lines,
- and spaces for indents.

We use the [EditorConfig format](http://editorconfig.org/) to harmonize indentation and file format in a project. For this to work, we need two things:

1. A `.editorconfig` file at the root of each project.
2. Your editor or IDE should have an EditorConfig plugin.

Please verify both points now if you’re not sure.
There are EditorConfig plugins for most code editors:

- [PhpStorm](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294-editorconfig)
- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig)

----
Example:

Here’s a reference `.editorconfig` file for new projects:

```ini
# http://EditorConfig.org
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

[*.{php,py}]
indent_size = 4
```
