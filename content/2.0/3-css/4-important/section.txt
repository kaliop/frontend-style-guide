Title: Avoid <code>!important</code>

----
Text:

Adding `!important` to your declarations helps fixing [specificity issues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity), but only in the very short term! Avoid it.

If you do use `!important` in your code, always write a comment explaining why.

----
Example:

```scss
.MyComponent-inner {
  // The JS library we use forces a width in JavaScript,
  // but we really need a fluid width here!
  width: auto !important;
}
```
