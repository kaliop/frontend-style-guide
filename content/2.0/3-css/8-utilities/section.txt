Title: Utility classes

----
Text:

Utilities are simple styles that can be used on any element to trigger some basic function (in a few lines of CSS at most).

-   Write utility classes in `camelCase`, without a prefix.
-   Avoid using *many* utility classes. They move a lot of the presentation logic into your HTML, and can hide that a component has dependencies (unlike mixins and variables).
-   If you have several utility classes that work together, maybe make a component?

Example:

```scss
// Utility classes

.icon {
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: middle;
    width: 1em;
    height: 1em;
}

.visuallyHidden {
    position: absolute !important;
    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
}
```
