Title: Comments

----
Text:

*   Use single-line comments (`// …`) to comment on the next line or the next few lines of code.
*   Use a JSDoc-style comment (`/** … */`) before a complex function or a module.

----
Example:

```js
/**
 *  Make a header "sticky"
 *  (Adds/removes a class when scrolling)
 */
function stickifyHeader(element, activeClass, offset) {

    // We had a latency of 250ms but we had too many
    // times when quick scrolling didn't update the
    // header's state.
    var LATENCY = 100;

    …
}
```
