Title: Organization

----
Text:

Organize your CSS code in multiple files. In particular, each component should be one file (even if it’s only 20 lines of code).

-   Try to keep files under a maximum of 500 lines.
-   Do not put two components in the same file.
-   Concatenate before serving to the browser (preprocessors give you “free” concatenation).
