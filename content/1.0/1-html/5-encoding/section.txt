Title: Character encoding

----
Text:

Always use UTF-8. Declare it first thing in the `<head>`, using the HTML5 short syntax. Ideally, the server should *also* declare the charset in the `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8` HTTP header.

Use literal characters if you can. The only characters that require the use of character entities are `<` and `&`. Do not encode text such as “français” (bad: `fran&#231;ais` or `fran&ccedil;ais`).

----
Example:

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- Everything else goes *after* the charset -->
</head>
```
