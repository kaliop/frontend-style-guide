Title: Viewport meta

----
Text:

For responsive websites, use a `viewport` meta in the page’s `head`.

*   Use `width=device-width`
*   Add `initial-scale=1` so that Safari does not zoom the content in portrait mode
*   _Do not_ use `maximum-scale`, ever!

More info: [detailed compatibility information](http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/metaviewport/).

This meta an be placed anywhere in the head, but we recommend putting it near the top with other “compatibility” stuff. So make sure your `<head>` always has, in this order: charset, X-UA-Compatible, viewport; then everything else.

----
Example:

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <title>…</title>
    <!-- Everything else -->
    …
</head>
```

```css
/* Windows Phone needs this in the CSS, or it understands "device-width" as "320px like the original iPhone" */
@-ms-viewport {
    width: device-width;
}
```
