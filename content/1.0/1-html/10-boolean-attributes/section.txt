Title: Boolean attributes

----
Text:

A boolean attribute is one that needs no declared value. XHTML required you to declare a value, but HTML5 has no such requirement.

For further reading, consult the [HTML5 section on boolean attributes](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#boolean-attributes):

> The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.

If you _must_ include the attribute’s value, and **you don’t need to**, follow this guideline:

> If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or […] the attribute’s canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.

**In short, don’t add a value.**

Example:

```html
<input type="text" disabled>

<input type="checkbox" value="1" checked>

<select>
    <option value="1" selected>1</option>
</select>
```
